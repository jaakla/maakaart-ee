#summary Install Bittorrent client (rtorrent and rssdler) to get and share latest planet

= Summary =

I use two CLI tools here to load and serve latest OSM planet from http://osm-torrent.torres.voyager.hr/ - rtorrent and rssdler. It is used in Ubuntu server, for desktop you have torrent GUI clients which just take RSS input easily.

= RSSdler =

tar xvzf rssdler-0.4.2.tar.gz
cd rssdler042/

  # Install and configure rtorrent
{{{
sudo apt-get install rtorrent

  # Configure rtorrent to follow local .torrent files: create *~/.rtorrent.rc* file:

# Default session directory. Make sure you don't run multiple instance
# of rtorrent using the same session directory. Perhaps using a
# relative path?
session = /home/jaakl/.torrents/session

# Watch a directory for new torrents, and stop those that have been
# deleted.
schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=/suur/planet/*.torrent
}}}
  # At last, start and keep running rtorrent (I use it in screen/byobu). I use it with specific incoming port as I have just one forwarded in the firewall
{{{
rtorrent -p 6881-6881

= TODO =
# Old downloaded files should be removed. Current system will download initially about 200GB and it is growing every week by 35GB or so.
